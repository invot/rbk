            <p>Web accessibility means creating digital resources on the web that everyone can use. This involves creating a web that is accessible to people with disabilities that may affect how they use the Web, including but not limited to visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive and neurological disabilities.</p>
            <p>An accessible web benefits <b>everyone</b>. People with or without disabilities. Web users and web developers. People with diverse needs and preferences. An accessible web gives people the flexibility to access digital materials in whatever way they need or want to.</p>

            <h3 id="visually-hidden-content">Visually hidden content</h3>

            <p>Content which should be visually hidden, but remain accessible to assistive technologies such as screen readers, can be styled using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sr-only</code> class. This can be useful in situations where additional visual information or cues (such as meaning denoted through the use of color) need to also be conveyed to non-visual users.</p>

            <figure class="highlight bg-grey border p-2">
<pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"text-danger"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"sr-only"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Danger: <span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
This action is not reversible
<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

            <p>For visually hidden interactive controls, such as traditional “skip” links, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sr-only</code> can be combined with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sr-only-focusable</code> class. This will ensure that the control becomes visible once focused (for sighted keyboard users).</p>

            <figure class="highlight bg-grey border p-2"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"sr-only sr-only-focusable"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"#content"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Skip to main content<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>
